                <p>
                    I have been developing a Spring Boot project with React on the frontend for a while but I could not get even closer to finalizing it becuase of my laziness. :-).
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    In order to keep the project going on and not waste my previous work, I will try to finish it in 30 days with a challenge. I will post every new update on this page and hopefully motivate myself to continue. I will write about what I have done and what I have learned during the day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project is mainly a social website but the main purpose is not to develop another social media platform. I basically try to learn React, Spring Boot, and develop RESTful API. So, it is better to think it as an educational project that I should finish to learn. Hope to see this page full of 30 days at the end of Ramadan :).

			<p>I'm Mehmet, a junior CENG student at Middle East Technical University. In this website, I post some of my projects and updates about myself. I am basically trying to keep this website as a portfolio. You can use the navbar to navigate through the website. Despite mainly being interested in technical subjects, I love graphic design and photography. You can look at the projects page for technical posts and the misc page for non-technical posts. You can find additional details about myself in the resume section, such as my experiences and schools.
				
			</p>

			<p>If you have any suggestions or questions about my projects or anything, you can reach me from my email: <b>mehmet.tokgoz@metu.edu.tr</b>. I appreciate your messages. Also you can find me on all social media platforms with a simple search.</p>
